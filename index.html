      <div id="us">

        <p>Anne speaking:</p>
        <p>I was waitressing at a bar when he came in with his friends. Him and I became friendly,
          played jokes on eachother and like that, he grew to be one fof my favourite customers.
        </p>
        <p>Then, there were few weeks when he didint show up at all and i realized that i really did miss him.
          I did not have any of his contact details. I told myself that if he ever came back,
          I needed to take the chance to ask him out.
        </p>
        <p>The next night he came in, i guess we both had the same idea. He asked me out before
          I could. I wrote my number in a peice of receipt paper, (whch he still has), and then we went out the next
          night. Its been 4years now and we are finally getting MARRIED!
